- In a similar manner, I was very excited about this assignment just like before. If completing the assignment and understanding it were both worth 10 points, it was quite challenging for me. That's because it was an entirely new topic, and a new journey began with this assignment in Mangal DB. So, it was quite challenging for me. However, doing assignment number 11 wasn't that difficult. What was in assignment 10 happened again in assignment 12. Everything was easy in assignment 12, but there was a bit of a problem with the payment option. However, I managed to solve it quickly.

- I didn't face any errors in this assignment. I encountered some minor errors, but I solved them myself.

- However, understanding the requirements for assignment 12 was not as difficult as it was for the previous assignment, which was assignment 11.

- It was a great journey with Programming Hero. I dedicated almost 8-10 hours a day to this course. It was challenging when I worked on assignments.Afterward, when I received the results, all the difficulties turned into joy. Sometimes, I felt demotivated, but listening to Jhankar Bhai's motivational words inspired me again, giving me the courage to believe that I could do it.Jhankar Bhai is an amazing person, and his deep thoughts have touched my heart. The use of the team members and their encouragement has fascinated me. They are all very good, and they can understand things very well. I pray for everyone. (Endless love)
